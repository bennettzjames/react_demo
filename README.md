##React##

* React is a javascript library.

* React was created by Facebook as a way to build large applications with data that changes over time. 

* Built around the the concept of one-way data-binding. Essentially, the view watches the data, and if the data changes, the view knows to only change the updated parts. 

* React is made up of components that make the code reusable, testable, and easier to debug. 

* Currently DOM manipulation is the slowest aspect of loading a webpage. React uses a virtual DOM that only renders once changes have been made. This is especially useful for mobile applications as mobile devices have a less powerful CPU than most desktop computers. 

* React can be written in javascript, however most developers use JSX, which is an enhanced version of JS. To put it simply, JSX is a combination of HTML and Javascript, with slightly ~~confusing~~ different syntax.
